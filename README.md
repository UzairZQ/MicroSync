# Features
Employee Location Tracking: The app allows managers to track the location of their sales representatives in real-time, ensuring they are visiting the right locations and making the most of their time.

Daily Call Reporting: Sales representatives can submit daily reports on their calls with doctors and other healthcare professionals, including details such as the name of the healthcare provider, the products discussed, and any feedback received.

Medicine Orders: Sales representatives can place orders for medicines and other products directly from the app, ensuring they have the supplies they need to meet their sales targets.

Weekly Call Planning: Sales representatives can plan their weekly calls in advance, setting reminders for upcoming appointments and ensuring they stay on track to meet their sales targets.

# Technologies Used
Flutter: Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google. It allows developers to build high-quality native interfaces for iOS and Android from a single codebase.

Firebase Firestore: Firebase Firestore is a cloud-based NoSQL document database. It provides real-time synchronization, making it a great choice for mobile applications.
